    <h3>Power of CWC</h3>
    <p><b>1] The J. J. Act states that the CWC shall function as a</b></p>

    <p>Bench of Magistrates and shall have the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) on a Metropolitan Magistrate(MM) or, as the case may be, a (JMFC)Judicial Magistrate of the first class. (Section 29 (5) of the JJ Act).</p>

    <p><b>2] Section 31 of the JJ Act clearly states that the Committee shall have the final authority to dispose of cases for the care, protection, treatment development and rehabilitation of the children as well as to provide for their basic needs and protection of human rights. Thus we see that the CWC will not have the specific powers conferred upon the JMFC or an MM under Section 29(2) of the CrPC however it does confer certain powers such as:</b></p>

    <p>i) Power to direct a police officer to investigate a non-cognisable case or a cognisable offence of which he has taken cognizance. All such orders issued should be signed by two members of the CWC.</p>

    <p>ii) Non- Cognisable offence - a police officer cannot arrest without a warrant and cannot investigate without the order of a Magistrate.</p>

    <p>iii) Cognisable offence - a police officer can arrest without a warrant or investigate without the order of a Magistrate.</p>

    <p>iv) To hold investigation or preliminary inquiry on receipt of the report by persons bringing the child before the CWC including a police officer.</p>

    <p><b>3] It is important to note that even though the CWC members function as a bench of magistrates they usually exercise executive functions. Therefore they have very few powers with respect to criminal aspects. The powers with respect to criminal aspects are:</b></p>

    <p>i) Taking evidence of the child, that is the childs statements.</p>

    <p>ii) Issuing of summons or warrants (Elaborated in Chapter 5 of this document).</p>

    <p>iii) Execution of various bonds.</p>

    <p><b>4] The CWC constituted for a district will have the power to deal exclusively with all proceedings under the Act relating to children in need of care and protection found in their jurisdiction. (Section 31 JJ Act).</b></p>

    <p><b>5] Further the CWC can prohibit the publication in print or visual media of the name, address or school or any other particulars calculated to lead to the identification of the child or publish a picture of any such child except when in its opinion such disclosure would be in the interest of the child. The CWC in such a case must make a note of the reasons for such disclosure. (Section 21 amendment 15 of 2006).</b></p>
